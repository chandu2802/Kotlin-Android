# Android Application using Kotlin



## ![Kotlin-768x427](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89723378/146815966-15942200-4e18-4c74-a081-109a54f38516.png)

## Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

## With @Nullable and @NonNull included in its type system, Kotlin helps you avoid NullPointerExceptions. Android apps that use Kotlin are 20% less likely to crash. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with the Java programming language, so you can have as little or as much of Kotlin in your project as you want.

## Kotlin is a free and open source project under the Apache 2.0 license. The code for the project is developed openly on GitHub primarily by the team employed at JetBrains, with contributions from Google and others.
